## The rules of the game ##

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implement RESTful service with Akka, Akka HTTP, Cats which serves as a very high level recommendation system.
There should be two requests with corresponding responses.

### Register user  
request sould be of the following format:  
```json
POST {"userName": "David", "email": "david@gmail.com", "age": 28, "gender": 1}
```

Request sould be validated:
- email
- age range `5-120`
- gender in `[1, 2]`, where `1` for male, `2` for female

Respose should be of format:  
```json
200 OK { "userId": 9797345L, "videoId":4324556L }
```

### Action  
Action is a response to Register, reaction on sent video.  
```json
POST {"userId": 9797345L, "videoId":4324556L, "actionId": 3}
```

where `userId` and `videoId` correspond to `Register` response.

Request should be validated for existing `userId`, `videoId` and `actionId`.

Response should of format:  
```json
200 OK
{ "userId": 9797345L, "videoId":6454556L }
```

For both requests there should be following error response format:  
```json
400 Bad Request
{ "errors": [
    "email is not valid", "age is not valid",
    "gender is not valid",
    "video does not correspond to last given",
    "video does not correspond to last given",
    "userId does not exist"
    ]
}
```

On every `Register` request there should be created a dedicated actor which tracks this user activity.  
`Actor` should track last video, such that if `Action` request sends id which was not given in previous response, it will reply with error (one above).

On `Action` request routing mechanism should validate if actor for `userId` exists, otherwise send error response (one above).

Generic validation should be done on Akka HTTP layer with `Cats` such that all errors are merged in single error response.

Video ids (`videoId`) should be preconfigured and limited to _10 random Long_ values, Action should select least watched from the list.

Action ids (`actionId`) are limited to the list `[1, 2, 3]` where:
```
 1 - like,
 2 - skip,
 3 - play.
```
That does not affect logic, just for background info.

Application should be build with SBT, and latest versions of Scala and libraries.

After `sbt run` application should be up and running on http://localhost:8085 `[/register]` and `[/action]`.
